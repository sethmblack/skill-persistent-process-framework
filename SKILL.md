# Persistent Process Framework

Transform overwhelming long-term challenges into sustainable daily practices, with clear progress indicators and motivation frameworks—following Marie Curie's four-year methodology for isolating radium.

---

## When to Use

- Facing a project that seems impossibly large or long
- Wanting to give up on difficult sustained effort
- Asking "how do I sustain this?" or "this will take forever"
- Starting a multi-year project without clear process
- Losing motivation on extended work

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| goal | Yes | The large objective to be achieved |
| current_state | No | Where you are now relative to the goal |
| time_available | No | Daily/weekly time that can be dedicated |
| obstacles | No | Known difficulties or challenges |
| motivation | No | Why this matters; what drives the effort |

## The Persistence Methodology

### The Core Insight

Marie Curie spent four years processing tons of pitchblende ore to isolate one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride. She did not think of it as four years of misery—she thought of it as daily work toward an important goal.

**The question is not whether progress is swift—meaningful work rarely is swift. The question is: does each day teach you something?**

### Step 1: Accept the True Scale

Acknowledge the full scope honestly:
- How long will this realistically take?
- What is the actual effort required?
- What have others who succeeded invested?
- What is the honest baseline, not the optimistic fantasy?

**Curie's principle:** "I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy."

### Step 2: Define the Daily Unit

Break the enormous into the manageable:
- What is one day's worth of progress?
- What action can be taken every single day?
- What is the minimum meaningful unit of work?
- What does "showing up" look like?

**Curie's method:** Each day: dissolve ore, precipitate fractions, test radioactivity, document results. Repeat.

### Step 3: Create Progress Indicators

Make the invisible visible:
- How will you measure incremental progress?
- What milestones mark the journey?
- What evidence shows you're moving forward?
- How will you know if you've drifted off course?

**Key insight:** Progress in long work is often invisible day-to-day but measurable week-to-week or month-to-month.

### Step 4: Normalize Difficulty

Expect hardship as part of the work, not exception to it:
- What difficulties are inherent to this work?
- What have others struggled with?
- What obstacles are to be expected, not surprised by?
- How does difficulty refine both you and the work?

**Curie's wisdom:** "Our laboratory was a former dissecting room—poorly ventilated, leaking when it rained, freezing in winter. Yet I remember those years with great tenderness. The difficulties were part of the work's charm."

### Step 5: Connect to Purpose

Anchor the daily in the meaningful:
- Why does this matter beyond personal success?
- Who benefits from this work being completed?
- What does this serve that is larger than yourself?
- What would be lost if this work were abandoned?

**Curie's motivation:** Pure scientific knowledge for its own beauty—and the chance that discovery may benefit humanity.

### Step 6: Focus on What Remains

Direct attention forward, not backward:
- What is the next step? (Not: how much have I done?)
- What can be accomplished today?
- What remains to be discovered?

**Curie's principle:** "I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Persistent Process Framework

[Clear statement of the large objective]

### True Scale Assessment
- **Realistic timeline:** [honest estimate]
- **Total effort:** [hours/days/iterations required]
- **Precedent:** [what similar efforts have taken]
- **Acceptance statement:** This work requires [X]. That is what it requires.

### Daily Unit Definition
**The daily practice:**
[Specific, concrete action that can be done every day]

**Minimum viable session:** [smallest meaningful unit]
**Full session:** [ideal daily effort]
**Time required:** [realistic daily time]

### Progress Indicators
| Milestone | Metric | Target Date |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [First checkpoint] | [How to measure] | [When] |
| [Second checkpoint] | [How to measure] | [When] |

**Weekly check:** [What to review each week]
**Monthly review:** [What to assess each month]

### Expected Difficulties
| Difficulty | Why It's Normal | Adaptation |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| [Challenge 1] | [Why expected] | [How to handle] |
| [Challenge 2] | [Why expected] | [How to handle] |

### Purpose Connection
**Why this matters:**
[Connection to larger meaning]

**Who benefits:**
[Beyond yourself]

**What would be lost:**
[If abandoned]

### Today's Focus
[Specific next action for today]
[What remains to be done next]
```

## Constraints

- Do not minimize the true scope—honesty enables persistence
- Do not promise quick results for slow work
- Do not ignore difficulty—normalize it instead
- Do not measure worth by speed—measure by consistency
- Do not look back too often—look forward

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I want to write a comprehensive book on my field, but it seems like it will take years and I don't know how to sustain that kind of effort."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Persistent Process Framework

### The Goal
Complete a comprehensive book on [field]—a lasting contribution to the discipline.

### True Scale Assessment
- **Realistic timeline:** 2-3 years for a substantial work
- **Total effort:** 500-800 hours of writing, plus research
- **Precedent:** Most serious nonfiction books require 2-5 years
- **Acceptance statement:** This work requires years, not months. A comprehensive book is not a sprint. That is what the work demands, and that is acceptable.

### Daily Unit Definition
**The daily practice:**
Write for one focused hour, minimum. No editing during writing. End each session by noting the next day's starting point.

**Minimum viable session:** 30 minutes / 300 words
**Full session:** 60 minutes / 800 words
**Time required:** 1 hour daily, 6 days per week

At 500 words/day average, 6 days/week:
- 3,000 words/week
- 12,000 words/month
- 80,000 word draft in ~7 months
- Plus revision, research, review: 2 years total is realistic

### Progress Indicators
| Milestone | Metric | Target Date |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Complete outline | All chapters defined | Month 1 |
| First chapter draft | 8,000-10,000 words | Month 2 |
| 25% complete | 20,000 words | Month 4 |
| 50% complete | 40,000 words | Month 7 |
| First full draft | 80,000 words | Month 12 |
| Revised draft | Ready for review | Month 18 |
| Final manuscript | Publication ready | Month 24 |

**Weekly check:** Word count progress, chapter completion status
**Monthly review:** Am I on pace? What adjustments needed?

### Expected Difficulties
| Difficulty | Why It's Normal | Adaptation |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| "I have nothing to say today" | Every writer faces this daily | Write anyway; edit later |
| "This chapter is terrible" | First drafts are supposed to be rough | Separate writing from editing |
| "Life interrupts" | Years-long projects face disruption | Resume the next day without guilt |
| "I've lost the thread" | Distance creates perspective loss | Re-read last chapter before writing |
| "This will never be finished" | Normal feeling at every stage | Trust the daily unit; it accumulates |

### Purpose Connection
**Why this matters:**
This book synthesizes knowledge that currently exists only in fragments. Students and practitioners in the field will have a comprehensive resource that doesn't currently exist.

**Who benefits:**
Future learners who will not have to piece together what you can present whole. Practitioners who will have a reference. The field itself, which gains a lasting contribution.

**What would be lost:**
The knowledge remains scattered. Those who follow must rediscover what you could have given them. The work that only you can do remains undone.

### Today's Focus
**Today's unit:** Write for one hour on [next section].
**Tomorrow's start:** [Note where to begin]

*"Each day we made progress, however small. That is how serious work advances—not by leaps, but by countless measured steps. Four years from now, you will have a book. Or four years from now, you will not. The days will pass either way."*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Marie Curie** expert persona. Use it when facing long-term work that seems overwhelming—the same methodology that enabled processing tons of ore to isolate a tenth of a gram of radium.
